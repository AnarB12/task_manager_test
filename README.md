# **Task Manager Web App (for fun)**

This is a simple practice task management web app created using **Flask**. It's a practice project since I have just started working on these kinds of web projects and want to learn more. My goal is to understand the basics of building web apps, handling user logins, and managing data like tasks.

## **Simple Features**

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create an account and log in.
- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, delete, and view tasks.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: You can check off tasks as "completed."
- **Search (kind of)**: There's a search feature to look for tasks based on titles or descriptions.
- **TOO Simple UI**: The interface is built with Bootstrap.

## **Techs Used**

- **Python**: For the server-side code.
- **Flask**: A simple web framework for building web apps.
- **SQLite**: For storing tasks and user data locally.
- **Bootstrap**: For making the web pages responsive.

## **Installation**


Make sure you have **Conda** installed and set up on your machine.


1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnarB12/task_manager_test.git
    cd task-manager
    ```

2. **Create and activate a Conda environment**:

    ```bash
    conda create -n task_manager_env python=3.10
    conda activate task_manager_env
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database**:

    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
    flask db upgrade
    ```

5. **Run the application**:

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

6. **Access the app**:  
    Go to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.


## **File Structure**

```bash

```


This project helped me practice:

- Creating user accounts and logging in/out with Flask.
- Managing tasks (create, edit, delete) in a database.
- Building simple web pages and layouts with Bootstrap.
- Using forms to submit data and process it in Python.

This is just a practice project to help me understand the basics.
